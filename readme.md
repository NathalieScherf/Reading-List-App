# The reading list app

A html, css and vanilla javaScript app that displays some books. 

There are 3 other branches: 

- [events](https://github.com/NathalieScherf/Reading-List-App/tree/events): On this branch you find some examples of event handling (changing the display of a book from "have read it" to "want to read it")


- [modules](https://github.com/NathalieScherf/Reading-List-App/tree/modules): On this branch we implement modules, i.e. split the code up into different files, working with the key words `export` and `import`. We also add some interactivity using an input field

- [fetch](https://github.com/NathalieScherf/Reading-List-App/tree/fetch): On this branch you have one example of fetching data from an api and dipslay it in our card layout. We use the api: [Open library](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
